      <h3>Print Advertising</h3>

      <p>Contrary to popular belief, print is not a dying form of advertising. There is something to be said about a marketing material that you can hold in your hand, or keep in the draw to reference at a later date. It is also becoming more popular to incorporate your print products into your online advertising. For example, you can send out that ad you loved as an email blast and post it to your social media accounts, or you can set up your guidebooks and brochures as resources that your viewers can download from your website or landing pages.

      <p>Direct mail is a powerful marketing tool. Use mail services to distribute your promotional items and get your brand and message into the hands of your target audience... literally. Direct mail can consist of a wide range of marketing materials, including postcards, newsletters, and letter packages.</p>

      <h3>Printed Newsletters </h3>

      <p>Printed newsletters are a great way to keep in touch with your customers, share industry related news and promote your brand. Although it is common to include calls to action, the primary purpose of the newsletter is to educate your reader, so you want your content to be informative and compelling. A strong design is important as well, because it doesn’t matter how good your content is, if your reader isn’t inspired to read it. It is recommended to send your newsletter out at a consistent frequency, whether it is monthly, quarterly or annually.</p>

      <h3>E-Newsletters </h3>

      <p>E-Newsletters are a great way to keep in touch with your customers, share industry related news and promote your brand. The primary purpose of the newsletter is to educate your reader, so you want your content to be informative and compelling, but you will also want to provide ways for the reader to visit your site for additional information. A strong design is important as well, because it will motivate your viewer to read your articles, as well as repeatedly promote your brand. It is recommended to send your E-Newsletter out at a consistent frequency, whether it is monthly, quarterly or annually.</p>



      <hr class="divider">


      <h3>Email Blasts </h3>

      <p>Market your message to a group of people through email. Use a catchy design to grab the attention of your viewers, and a strong headline and subject line that will convey your message and intrigue them to read further. The most successful email blasts are well thought out, and provide click throughs that will drive the reader to your website for more information.</p>

      <h3>Fine Art</h3>

      <p>Fine art was the gateway in which I entered the world of Graphic Design. I feel that for a designer to be successful, it is important that they have an artistic eye, and an understanding of the fine art techniques that many of our design programs were built upon. </p>

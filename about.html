      <h3>Past</h3>

      <p>Since I was a little girl, I knew I wanted to create. It didn’t matter if it was a larger than life drawing of my body’s insides, soap dishes made of cooked dough (bad idea) or an underwater breathing apparatus (worse idea), I was my happiest when I got to exercise my mind and create what I envisioned. Fortunately, I have a wonderful family who has supported me through all my seemingly crazy aspirations and they are who I accredit for the success I’ve had in such a demanding field. </p>

      <h3>Present</h3>

      <p>Although I have already obtained my Masters Degree and finished my schooling, I still consider myself a student. There is so much in this field that intrigues me and it is in my nature to learn from whatever resources are available to me and master the skills needed to compliment my talents. </p>

      <h3>Future</h3>

      <p>I don’t know what the future has in store for me, I just have to hope that I am prepared to meet it. In the mean time, I hope to continue my education and expand on the learning I experience through work, networking and while studying abroad. </p>

      <p class="quote">The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. - Eleanor Roosevelt </p>
